# VoiceFont.js
generous TTS method in javascript discarding cloud calls


Same method soundfont process except using phonetics instead scores. 
it is obvious that how sound fonts produces polyphonic, fast and accurate smooth flooding harmonic sounds. 

It is also obvious that recent TTS techics far from future development requiring huge supports, While Voice Font has widen development at easy. 

#WHY LIMIT MUSIC WITH SCORES.?

After now people shall talk like muzik at wide range of effects.

imagine when u say "Don`t do that" people hears you like drums playing at background....
or soft as a flute spreads at space.
##see how could be: https://gultekinmg.github.io/voicefont/
or music and voice together, Tough scores injected phonetics requires detailed work.
with Polyphonic sounding you can spell a charachter with background vocals and instruments together. "named Accords."

But at easy you can record your phonetics at a simulated score.


Beside, it is too easy to create a new voice instrument charachter just implementing a few phonetics.

AND, YES You can TALK diffent langUages like a piece of cake impleMEnting their phonetics also. 

NO LIMITS....
