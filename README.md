Same method soundfont processing except using phonetics instead scores. 
it is obvious that how sound fonts produces polyphonic, fast and accurate smooth flooding harmonic sounds. 

WHY LIMIT MUSIC WITH SCORES.?

After now people shall talk like muzik at wide range of effects. 
imagine when u say "Don`t do that" people hears you like drums playing at background....

Beside, it is too easy to create a new voice instrument charachter just implementing a few phonetics.

AND, YES You can TALK diffent langUages like a piece of cake impleMEnting their phonetics also. 

NO LIMITS....
