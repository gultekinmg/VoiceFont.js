# VoiceFont.js
generous TTS method in javascript discarding cloud calls


Same method soundfont process except using phonetics instead scores. 
_it is obvious that how sound fonts produces polyphonic, fast and accurate smooth flooding harmonic sounds._

It is also obvious that recent TTS techics far from future development requiring huge supports, While Voice Font has widen development at easy. 

## WHY LIMIT MUSIC WITH SCORES.? :flushed:

After now people shall talk like muzik at wide range of effects.

or music and voice together, Tough scores injected phonetics requires detailed work.
with Polyphonic sounding you can spell a charachter with background vocals and instruments together. "named Accords."

But at easy you can record your phonetics at a simulated score.


Beside, it is too easy to create a new voice instrument charachter just implementing a few phonetics.

__AND, YES You can TALK diffent langUages like a piece of cake__ impleMEnting their phonetics also. 

NO LIMITS....
