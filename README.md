generous TTS method in javascript discarding cloud calls


Same method soundfont process except using phonetics instead scores. 
it is obvious that how sound fonts produces polyphonic, fast and accurate smooth flooding harmonic sounds. 

It is also obvious that recent TTS techics far from future development requiring huge supports, While Voice Font has widen development at easy. 

WHY LIMIT MUSIC WITH SCORES.?

After now people shall talk like muzik at wide range of effects. 
imagine when u say "Don`t do that" people hears you like drums playing at background....

Beside, it is too easy to create a new voice instrument charachter just implementing a few phonetics.

AND, YES You can TALK diffent langUages like a piece of cake impleMEnting their phonetics also. 

NO LIMITS....
